BW Photo API
============

Create a REST API, which 
- handles photos from url (from the web, ex: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/7992673887_a882d4e269_c.jpg)
- or base64 upload (maximum 2 MB)
- and with some metadata (title, camera, date, author)
- convert the photos asynchronously to black&white and crop into square shape
- give a list of the converted photos (with metadata)
- and can filter the list with a "from" timestamp

Then write a very simple and lightweight frontend, which 
- use this API to upload photos (with metadata) from the user machine
- and gives an automatically updated list of the newly converted photos

Work with TDD, so always write rspec/cucumber tests first!
