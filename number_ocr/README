You work for a bank, which has recently purchased an ingenious machine to assist in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices. The machine scans the paper documents, and produces a file with a number of entries which each look like this:
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _| 
                           
Each entry is 4 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. The first 3 lines of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and underscores, and the fourth line is blank. Each account number should have 9 digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. A normal file contains around 500 entries.

Your first task is to write a program that can take this file and parse it into actual account numbers.

Example file:

    _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _| _| _||_|  ||_||_|

    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  | _| _|  | _||_|  ||_||_|

    _  _     _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_|| |
  | _| _|  | _||_|  ||_||_|

Result should be:

123956788
133456788
133456780
